# Using Data

**Let's look at how you can use the `useMaho` hook to manage your component's state.**

If you'd like to jump right to comparing `useMaho` to other state solutions, check out the links below for the same component implemented in several different ways:

- [useState](/docs/data_useState)
- [useReducer](/docs/data_useReducer)
- [xstate](/docs/data_xstate) / [xstate serialized](/docs/data_xstateSerialized)
- [useMaho](/docs/data_useMaho) / [useMaho serialized](/docs/data_useMahoSerialized)

## Defining Data

In a `Maho` machine, **data** is an optional object for holding the data context of your machine. You can give this option whatever properties you want. On each update, the `data` object's current values will be available as shown below.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [state] = useMaho({
    data: {
      count: 0
    }
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {state.data.count}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Updating Data

Unlike a regular `useState` hook, the `useMaho` hook does not provide a way to arbitrarily change this data.

Instead, you'll define a set of **event handlers** with **actions** that can mutate the `data`. You will then trigger those event handlers through **events** that you **send** to the hook.

An initial solution might look something like this:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [state, send] = useMaho({
    data: {
      count: 0
    },
    on: {
      INCREMENT: {
        do: data => data.count++
      },
      DECREMENT: {
        do: data => data.count--
      }
    }
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {state.data.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => send("INCREMENT")}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => send("DECREMENT")}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Let's break down each of those concepts.

### Event Handlers

An **event handler** is a named thing that happens in your component. Many things can happen as a result of an event, but for now we'll just focus on the event handler's **actions**, or how the event should effect the `data` state.

In a `useMaho` hook, you'll define the hook's "root" event handlers in the `on` object.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [state, send] = useMaho({
    data: {
      count: 0
    },
    // highlight-start
    on: {
      INCREMENT: {
        do: data => data.count++
      },
      DECREMENT: {
        do: data => data.count--
      }
    }
    // highlight-end
  })
```

As we'll see later when learning about states, event handlers defined here will always be available, regardless of the hook's current state.

### Actions

An event handler's actions are defined in the event object's `do` property.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [state, send] = useMaho({
    data: {
      count: 0
    },
    on: {
      INCREMENT: {
        do: data => data.count++ // highlight-line
      },
      DECREMENT: {
        do: data => data.count-- // highlight-line
      }
    }
  })
```

An **action** is a function that receives the current `data`, together with a `payload`, and mutates that data. (We'll learn about payloads later on.)

Note that, unlike a standard `useState` or `useReducer` hook, **you do not have to return the new state** from an action function. It's enough to just mutate the `data` parameterâ€”the `useMaho` hook will take care of immutability for you.

### Sending Events

Finally, to kick off an event handler, you'll use the hook's `send` method to **send** an **event** to the machine.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => send("INCREMENT")}>Increment</button>
```

If the machine has a matching event handler in its available event handlers, that handler will run.
